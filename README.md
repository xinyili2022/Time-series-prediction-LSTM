# Time-series-prediction-LSTM

Here is the explanation of the three ipynb file. The one "HW_...." is the one without updating the model to the best model, I forgot to do this step at first, and you don't have to pay attention to that one.

The one "Updated" is the version after updating the best model and uploaded this Monday. While, the understanding of time lag in  this version is that for example, using the previous FIVE DAYS' stock price to predict the price of today.

The one "Final" is the version updated this Thursday, and the understanding of time lag here is using the stock in the previous FIFTH DAY to predict the price of today.

Also, that is the same for the ppt(slides) file, "Updated_" and "Final". In the "Final_" pdf/slide file, the updated condition and the comparison of the two various understandings are both introduced.
